  Stein (stylized as <b>stein.</b>) is a bit of a coding experiment. Namely, it's an attempt to write a website with the basic functionality of Tumblr, but without any of the glaring problems, and also with some better design choices. I do not imagine it will ever be used; it is simply an experiment to see just how incompetent the coding of Tumblr actually is.<br /><br />
